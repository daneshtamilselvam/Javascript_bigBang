Problem: There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to predict when the big bang will happen again.

Solution: Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow:
[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”, .... all the way to 100]

In this case, I used Microsoft Visual Studio as my tool to run the Javascript.

How to run the script?
* Before running the script make sure Node.js has been downloaded.
* Node.js allows us to run any javascript file outside a web browser.

Step 1: Download the file from folder Javascript_bigBang which is bigBang.js
Step 2: From using Microsoft Visual Studio
Step 3:
